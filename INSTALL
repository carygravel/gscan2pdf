Installing
----------

The program itself for gscan2pdf is in one file, so having extracted it to the
current directory, you can just run it with

 bin/gscan2pdf


For those who want an install script, I have included one. First build with:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make


From a system that uses sudo, like Ubuntu, you will need:

 sudo make install

Otherwise change to root with

 su

and then

 make install

followed by CRTL-D to get back to the original user.

gscan2pdf will then be on the path an accessible from any directory with

 gscan2pdf


If you have a Debian system (like Ubuntu) then you can make a .deb with

 perl Makefile.PL
 make debdist

and then install it with

 sudo dpkg -i gscan2pdf-<version>.deb

This has the advantage of not having to hold on to the Makefile in order to
uninstall it.


Alternatively, add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/jeffreyratcliffe/ubuntu <release> main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/jeffreyratcliffe/ubuntu <release> main

where <release> is the version of Ubuntu you are using. hardy & gutsy are
supported at the time of writing. intrepid, feisty and dapper will follow as
soon as I get gtkimageview to build against those distro.

If you are you are using Synaptic, then use menu
'Edit/Reload Package Information', search for gscan2pdf in the package list,
and lo and behold, you can install the nice shiny new version automatically.

From the command line:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gscan2pdf


If you have a system that uses RPMs, like Fedora or Suse, you can build an RPM
with:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make rpmdist


The help will require Gtk2::Ex::PodViewer. Rotating requires Imagemagick.
Having installed gscan2pdf, locate the gscan2pdf entry in Synaptic,
right-click it and you can install them under "Recommends".


Uninstalling
------------

If you have installed gscan2pdf with

 make install

as described about, then you can uninstall it with:

 sudo make uninstall

or

 su

and then

 make uninstall

as appropriate.


Alternatively, if you installed the .deb, you can uninstall it with your
favourite graphical package manager (e.g. Synaptic), or with

 sudo dpkg -r gscan2pdf
