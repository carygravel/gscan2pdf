Installing
----------

The program itself for gscan2pdf is in one file, so having extracted it to the
current directory, you can just run it with

 ./gscan2pdf


For those who want an install script, I have included one:

From a system that uses sudo, like Ubuntu, you will need:

 sudo make install

Otherwise change to root with

 su

and then

 make install

followed by CRTL-D to get back to the original user.

gscan2pdf will then be on the path an accessible from any directory with

 gscan2pdf


If you have a Debian system (like Ubuntu) then you can make a .deb with

 make dist

and then install it with

 sudo dpkg -i gscan2pdf-0.7.11.deb

This has the advantage of not having to hold on to the Makefile in order to uninstall it.



Uninstalling
------------

If you have installed gscan2pdf with

 make install

as described about, then you can uninstall it with:

 sudo make uninstall

or

 su

and then

 make uninstall

as appropriate.


Alternatively, if you installed the .deb, you can uninstall it with your favourite graphical package manager (e.g. Synaptic), or with

 sudo dpkg -r gscan2pdf
