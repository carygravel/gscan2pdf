%description
Only two clicks are required to scan several pages and then save all or a
selection as a PDF or DjVu file, including metadata if required.

gscan2pdf can control regular or sheet-fed (ADF) scanners with SANE via
scanimage or scanadf, and can scan multiple pages at once. It presents a
thumbnail view of scanned pages, and permits simple operations such as rotating
and deleting pages. 

PDF conversion is done by PDF::Builder.

The resulting document may be saved as a PDF, DjVu or a multipage TIFF file.
