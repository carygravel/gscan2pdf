Description: A GUI to ease the process of producing PDFs from scanned documents
 At maturity, the GUI will have similar features to that of the Windows Imaging program, but with the express objective of writing a PDF, including metadata.
 .
 Scanning is handled with SANE via scanimage.
 .
 PDF conversion is done by libtiff.
 .
 Perl is used for portability and ease of programming, with gtk2-perl for the GUI. This should therefore work more or less out of the box on any system with Perl, gtk2-perl, scanimage and libtiff.
